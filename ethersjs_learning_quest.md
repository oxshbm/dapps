# ðŸª„ Ethers.js Learning Quest: Building an On-Chain TODO List

Welcome, developer! This guide will walk you through learning **Ethers.js** while building a simple decentralized TODO app. Along the way, you'll discover *why* Ethers.js matters and the core concepts behind it.

---

## ðŸ“– Why Ethers.js?

Think of Ethereum as a massive library. Inside it are countless books (smart contracts), each filled with spells (functions) written in an obscure language (bytecode). Humans canâ€™t read or cast them directly.

You, the builder, have written your own book (smart contract). You want others to **open it, read its spells, and even cast them**. But without a translator, youâ€™re stuck.

Thatâ€™s where **Ethers.js** comes in. Itâ€™s like your **wand** for interacting with Ethereum:
- **Provider** â†’ The librarian who fetches data about the blockchain.  
- **Signer** â†’ Your identity, the one who signs transactions and proves they come from you.  
- **Contract** â†’ The bridge that turns ABI definitions into callable JavaScript functions.  
- **Events** â†’ Whispers from contracts when something happens (like state changes).  
- **Utils** â†’ Handy tools for ETH conversion, address validation, and encoding.  

Without Ethers.js, youâ€™d be left writing raw JSON-RPC requests (ugly hex strings). With it, working with Ethereum feels smooth and natural for web developers.

## ðŸš€ Practice Project: On-Chain TODO List

Weâ€™ll build a smart contract to manage tasks, then interact with it using Ethers.js.

### Step 1: Solidity Smart Contract (Todo.sol)
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Todo {
    struct Task {
        string text;
        bool completed;
    }

    Task[] public tasks;

    event TaskAdded(uint id, string text);
    event TaskCompleted(uint id);

    function addTask(string calldata _text) external {
        tasks.push(Task(_text, false));
        emit TaskAdded(tasks.length - 1, _text);
    }

    function completeTask(uint _id) external {
        tasks[_id].completed = true;
        emit TaskCompleted(_id);
    }

    function getTasks() external view returns (Task[] memory) {
        return tasks;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy the Contract
- Deploy to a testnet (Sepolia/Goerli) or local Hardhat/Foundry node.  
- Save the **contract address** and **ABI**.  

---

### Step 3: Ethers.js Frontend Integration

#### Connect Wallet
```js
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
```

#### Load Contract
```js
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer);
```

#### Read Tasks
```js
const tasks = await contract.getTasks();
console.log(tasks);
```

#### Add Task
```js
const tx = await contract.addTask("Buy Milk");
await tx.wait();
```

#### Complete Task
```js
const tx = await contract.completeTask(0);
await tx.wait();
```

#### Listen for Events
```js
contract.on("TaskAdded", (id, text) => {
  console.log("Task Added:", id, text);
});
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How **Providers** fetch blockchain data.  
- How **Signers** represent your wallet.  
- How **Contracts** turn ABI into real functions.  
- How **Events** keep your UI live and reactive.  
- How **Utils** simplify working with ETH and addresses.  

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps
Once the TODO app works:
- Add **deadlines** or **owners** to tasks in Solidity.  
- Deploy on a **testnet** and share with friends.  
- Build a nicer **React + Ethers.js frontend** with task lists and buttons.  

With this quest, you now hold the wand (Ethers.js) to bend Ethereum to your will. âš¡
